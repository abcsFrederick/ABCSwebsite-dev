The role of object-oriented programming frequently leads to spirited discussions among software developers. In this talk we show practical examples in several programming languages (Python, Java, C++) that demonstrate how object orientation can make your code shorter, more flexible, easier to read and maintain. Also, design patterns that lead to a new level of reasoning about software architectures will be presented. New developments as well as strategies for preventing common pitfalls will be discussed.

A second talk will introduce OOP in R based on the most commonly used S3 system and explain the relationship between objects and their methods (a.k.a. functions in the context of OOP).  We will show how R classifies and identifies S3 objects. An example will show how easy it is to create S3 generic functions. We will conclude the talk by introducing the S4 system which forms the backbone of Bioconductor packages.
