<sup><sub>Putative driver gene mutations and copy number alterations at treatment initiation. **a** Treatment schema, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and number of samples per cohort that underwent whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-sequencing at the indicated time points. Box plot shows the median, the interquartile range (IQR), and Tukey whiskers (±1.5 times IQR). **b** Distribution of clonal (black) and subclonal (tan) putative CLL driver mutations and copy number alterations (blue) across the 61 patients<sup>1</sup></sub></sup>

Over the last decade, cancer researchers realized the importance of clonal evolution and how it aids malignancies to escape chemoimmunotherapy. Dr. Adrian Wiestner, of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), and his team are interested in understanding why chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), most common among western countries, is effectively controlled by ibrutinib during the early stages of treatment, only to fail later due to the emergence of resistant subclones. To explore the evolutionary landscape, Dr. Wiestner and his team carried out an unbiased sequencing of serially collected samples. The study identified two genes BTK and PLCG2 from the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway as the central players in the ibrutinib resistance. ABCS scientists worked with Dr. Wiestner and his team to carry out the impact analysis of PLCG2 genetic variations on protein function.
