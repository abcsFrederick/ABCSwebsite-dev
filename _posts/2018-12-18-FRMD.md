<sup><sub>FRMD generated structure of Secretoglobin SCGB3A2 dimer (monomers in yellow and green) in two views rotated 180Deg around the vertical axis. The very large charge segregation (positively charged residues in blue; negatively charged residues in red) is responsible for SCGB3A2 properties.

Molecular biology and biophysics techniques can produce large amounts of information from different sources. This information ranges from one-dimensional (1D) sequences to circular dichroism (CD) spectra. This wealth of information is seldom combined actively when refining the crude macromolecular structure models which are frequently produced to understand the function of macromolecules of unknown structure. The ABCS has developed techniques that take advantage of large sets of disparate information to improve and assess three-dimensional (3D) models. The technique is based on a generally self-consistent procedure (Feedback Restrained Molecular Dynamics, FRMD) used to connect multiple trajectories to bias the search towards a common conformation allowing the combination of multiple data sources including data from homologous structures for which X-ray or electron microscopy (EM) data is available. The technique is being applied at the ABCS to a variety of targets, including the following examples:

* Toll Like Receptors of unknown structure
* Secretoglobin SCGB3A2, a promoter of pyroptotic LLC cell death proposed as a mechanism to eliminate neoplastic cells using "pyroptosis" mechanism through non-canonical inflammasome pathway
* Sirtulines
* More recently, a Uric Acid transporter, a Glucose transporter member 9 (GLU9) of unknown structure
